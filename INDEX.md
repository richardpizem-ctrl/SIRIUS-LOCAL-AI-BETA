# SIRIUS‑LOCAL‑AI  
**A fully modular, offline AI runtime with a stable architecture, plugin ecosystem, and real‑time processing.**

SIRIUS‑LOCAL‑AI is a next‑generation local AI framework designed for **speed, stability, modularity, and full offline autonomy**.  
Version **2.0.0** introduces a complete Runtime 2.0 architecture, Plugin System 2.0, Workflow Engine 2.0, AI Loop 2.0, GUI 2.0, and a fully stabilized module ecosystem.

The entire system runs **100% locally**, without external dependencies or cloud services.

## 🚀 Key Features

### **Modular Architecture (v2.0.0)**
Each module is isolated and follows strict boundaries:

- `commands/` – NL routing and command logic  
- `context/` – context memory engine  
- `filesystem/` – safe file operations  
- `runtime/` – Runtime Core 2.0  
- `triage/` – AITE 2.0  
- `ui/` – GUI logic  
- `ui_components/` – graphical elements  
- `workflow/` – Workflow Engine 2.0  
- `plugins/` – Plugin System 2.0  
- `security_family/` – **NEW (planned for v3.0.0): behavior‑based identity, family safety, time‑limits, schoolwork priority**

The system is designed to be extended **without modifying the core**.

---

### **Plugin System 2.0**
Plugins can define:

- NL commands  
- AI tasks  
- workflows  
- AI loop rules  
- GUI elements  

All official plugins are fully prepared for v2.0.0.

---

### **Automatic Input Triage Engine (AITE 2.0)**
AITE analyzes inputs, classifies them, and routes them to the correct modules.

It ensures:

- correct input type detection  
- safe routing  
- deterministic behavior  
- zero conflicts between modules  
- **(v3.0.0) Schoolwork Priority Mode — academic tasks always bypass FAMILY restrictions**

---

### **Real‑Time Processing**
The system includes a custom real‑time engine with:

- a stable event loop  
- optimized processing  
- low latency  
- predictable performance  

---

### **GUI Layer 2.0**
The UI is built on modular components:

- `ui/` – UI logic  
- `ui_components/` – graphical elements  
- `ui_components/animations/` – animations (ready for v2.0.0 and v3.0.0)  

---

### **Workflow Engine 2.0**
The workflow layer manages:

- multi‑step processes  
- safe command execution  
- plugin workflows  
- predictable state transitions  
- UI feedback
