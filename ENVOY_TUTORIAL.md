# 🌐 SIRIUS ENVOY 5 — Tutorial & Concept Guide (Runtime 5.6.1 Unified)
### Safe External Retrieval Layer for SIRIUS LOCAL AI (Unified Reasoning & Deep Explainability Architecture 5.6)

SIRIUS ENVOY 5 is an **isolated external‑retrieval agent** that allows SIRIUS LOCAL AI to safely obtain information from the internet **without exposing the local AI runtime to any network communication**.

This **v5.6.1 unified edition** reflects the upgraded Runtime 5.x architecture, including:

- ENVOY Execution Layer 5  
- ENVOY Permission Layer 5  
- System Agent 5  
- Identity Engine 3.0  
- Security Family 5.x  
- AITE 5.6  
- Unified Knowledge Graph 5.6  
- KG_EXPLAIN & KG_EXPLAIN_DEEP  
- Reasoning Engine 5.6 (multi‑hop, inheritance, transitivity)  
- Workflow Engine 5.6 (explainability routing)  
- Unified PC + Mobile runtime  
- Deterministic cross‑platform routing  
- Hardened quarantine + validation pipeline  

This document explains:

- what ENVOY is  
- why it exists  
- how it works  
- how the quarantine system functions  
- how data flows into the local AI  
- what ENVOY is strictly forbidden from doing  
- how ENVOY integrates with Runtime 5.6.1 Unified Architecture

# 🧩 1. What Is SIRIUS ENVOY 5?

ENVOY is a **small external process** with a single purpose:

> **Go online, retrieve information, pass it through quarantine, and deliver clean, safe text to the offline SIRIUS runtime.**

The local SIRIUS runtime:

- never goes online  
- never sends data out  
- never receives unfiltered content  
- never communicates with external servers  

ENVOY acts as a **one‑way, outbound‑only bridge**, fully isolated from the main runtime.

---

# 🛡 2. Why Does ENVOY Exist?

SIRIUS is a 100% offline system.  
However, some tasks require external information:

- updating Knowledge Packs  
- retrieving definitions  
- gathering safe educational content  
- obtaining basic health information  
- expanding troubleshooting data  
- refreshing domain knowledge  

ENVOY enables this **without compromising offline safety**.

### ENVOY allows:

- **external information retrieval**  
- **without putting the local AI online**  
- **without risking data leaks**  
- **without allowing unsafe content**  
- **without exposing identity or local files**  

---

# 🧱 3. ENVOY 5 Architecture (Runtime 5.6.1)

ENVOY consists of **six hardened layers**:

## 3.1 ENVOY Permission Layer 5
- validates every request  
- checks identity context  
- enforces OWNER/FAMILY/STRANGER rules  
- blocks unauthorized fetches  
- ensures user confirmation  
- integrates with KG_EXPLAIN & KG_EXPLAIN_DEEP for explainability of permission decisions  

## 3.2 Envoy Client (Outbound‑Only)
- the only process allowed to access the internet  
- cannot access local files  
- cannot access runtime memory  
- cannot receive external commands  
- outbound‑only, no inbound channels  
- unified PC/Mobile behavior  

## 3.3 Scraper Layer
- extracts clean text  
- removes HTML, scripts, ads, trackers  
- normalizes content  
- strips formatting and embedded objects  
- blocks binary or executable content  

## 3.4 Quarantine Sandbox
- fully isolated environment  
- checks structure and format  
- detects unsafe patterns  
- blocks unknown data types  
- prevents any executable or active content  
- enforces strict content‑type rules  
- logs explainability traces for KG_EXPLAIN & KG_EXPLAIN_DEEP  

## 3.5 Validator & Policy Filter
- enforces safety rules  
- flags uncertain information  
- filters restricted topics  
- ensures consistency  
- removes dangerous or unverifiable content  
- applies Security Family 5.x rules  
- produces explainable validation output  

## 3.6 Safe Payload Delivery
- produces **clean text**  
- structured JSON  
- ready for local AI modules  
- compatible with Unified Knowledge Graph 5.6  
- deterministic, predictable output

# 🔄 4. How ENVOY Works – Step by Step (Runtime 5.6.1)

## 1️⃣ User makes a request  
Example: “Update the Cooking Pack with information about rice.”

## 2️⃣ Runtime creates an ENVOY task  
Contains only:

- topic  
- allowed sources  
- safety rules  
- identity context  

## 3️⃣ Permission Layer 5 validates the request  
If not allowed → blocked.

## 4️⃣ ENVOY goes online  
Retrieves information based on the task.

## 5️⃣ Scraper Layer cleans the data  
Only text remains.

## 6️⃣ Quarantine Sandbox isolates the content  
Everything is checked.

## 7️⃣ Validator applies safety rules  
Removes:

- dangerous advice  
- medical diagnoses  
- legal/financial instructions  
- unverified claims  
- scripts, HTML, links  
- unsafe or ambiguous content  

## 8️⃣ Data is converted into Pack format  
Examples:

- `facts.json`  
- `glossary.json`  
- `rules.json`  

## 9️⃣ Local AI receives clean, safe content  
Knowledge Pack is updated locally.

# 🚫 5. What ENVOY Never Does

ENVOY is strictly forbidden from:

- sending local data outward  
- accessing user files  
- interacting directly with the runtime  
- storing data outside quarantine  
- executing code  
- returning HTML, scripts, or images  
- bypassing safety rules  
- modifying Knowledge Packs directly  
- performing UI automation  
- interacting with the **UI Automation Engine 5.0**  
- bypassing **System Agent 5**  
- bypassing **SECURITY FAMILY 5.x**  
- bypassing **Identity Engine 3.0**  
- altering runtime behavior  
- triggering OS‑level actions  
- accessing identity data  
- accessing local files  

ENVOY is a **one‑directional, outbound‑only, isolated process**.

---

# 🧠 6. How ENVOY Supports Knowledge Graph 5.6

ENVOY enables:

- adding new facts  
- updating definitions  
- expanding glossaries  
- extending troubleshooting trees  
- retrieving safe educational content  
- enriching cooking data  
- adding basic health & safety information (no diagnosis)  
- updating semantic metadata  

All of this happens **without putting SIRIUS online**.

---

# 🔗 7. Integration with Runtime 5.6.1 Unified Architecture

ENVOY’s role remains strictly informational.

ENVOY **does not**:

- trigger UI actions  
- interact with UIParser 5.x  
- influence UIWorkflow 5.x  
- bypass identity rules  
- modify system‑level automation  
- bypass System Agent 5  
- bypass ENVOY sanitization rules  
- modify runtime behavior  

ENVOY **does**:

- provide sanitized text for Reasoning Engine 5.6  
- update Knowledge Graph Packs 5.x  
- support semantic workflows  
- enrich academic and household modules  
- operate under hardened quarantine rules  
- follow unified PC/Mobile behavior  
- produce explainability traces for KG_EXPLAIN & KG_EXPLAIN_DEEP
