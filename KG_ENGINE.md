# 🧠 KG ENGINE 6.x — Knowledge Graph Core  
**Status:** ✔ Active  
**Version:** 6.x  
**SIRIUS Local AI Version:** 5.7.0  
**Component:** KG ENGINE  
**Role:** Unified symbolic knowledge graph engine powering explainability, relations, exports, imports, and multi-hop reasoning

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
The KG ENGINE 6.x module is the central symbolic knowledge system of SIRIUS Local AI.  
It manages entities, relations, semantic structures, and graph-based reasoning operations.  
All explainability, relation discovery, and multi-hop inference rely on this engine.

KG ENGINE provides deterministic, transparent, and fully inspectable knowledge operations.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview  
**Runtime 5.x → KG ENGINE → ReasoningEngine5 → AUTONOMY → COLNÍK → EXECUTE**

### Core Responsibilities  
- Manage entities and relations  
- Provide semantic explainability (KG_EXPLAIN, KG_EXPLAIN_DEEP)  
- Perform relation discovery (KG_RELATE)  
- Handle graph import/export  
- Support multi-hop reasoning  
- Maintain deterministic symbolic structure  
- Provide comfort commands for developer workflow  

### Key Files  
- `KG/kg_engine.py`  
- `KG/kg_store/`  
- `KG/autosave_kg.json`  
- `KG/kg_export.json`  
- `KG/kg_import.json`

## 🧱 Knowledge Structure  

### **Entities**  
Fundamental nodes representing concepts, objects, categories, or abstract ideas.

### **Relations**  
Directed semantic links between entities, such as:  
- `A is B`  
- `A part_of B`  
- `A related_to B`  
- `A causes B`  

### **Metadata**  
Each relation stores:  
- confidence  
- novelty score  
- origin module  
- timestamps  
- multi-hop depth  

---

## 🔍 Core Operations  

### **KG_EXPLAIN**  
Provides a human-readable explanation of why two entities are connected.  
Shows direct relations and supporting metadata.

### **KG_EXPLAIN_DEEP**  
Generates multi-hop explanations across several layers of the graph.  
Used for deep symbolic reasoning and transparency.

### **KG_RELATE**  
Discovers semantic relations between two entities using:  
- direct edges  
- multi-hop paths  
- transitive inference  
- novelty scoring  

### **KG_EXPORT**  
Exports the entire knowledge graph into a portable JSON structure.

### **KG_IMPORT**  
Loads external or saved knowledge graphs into the engine.

### **Comfort Commands**  
Developer-friendly commands:  
- `kg add entity X`  
- `kg add relation A B`  
- `kg list entities`  
- `kg list relations`  
- `kg search X`  
- `kg rename entity`  
- `kg unset relation`  

---

## 🔄 Operational Cycle  

### **1 — Load KG**  
KG ENGINE loads the current graph from:  
`KG/kg_store/`  
or  
`autosave_kg.json`

### **2 — Process Operation**  
Depending on the request:  
- add entity  
- add relation  
- explain  
- relate  
- export  
- import  

### **3 — Update Graph**  
All changes are deterministic and validated.  
Autosave is triggered after each modification.

### **4 — Provide Output**  
Results are returned to:  
- ReasoningEngine5  
- AUTONOMY  
- Developer Mode (UI PANEL)

## 🔐 Safety Rules  
- ❌ No destructive graph operations without confirmation  
- 🔒 Autosave ensures graph integrity  
- 🧠 Deterministic relation evaluation  
- ⚠ Multi-hop depth capped to prevent runaway inference  
- 🛡 No modification of autonomy logic  

---

## 📊 Module Status  
- ✔ Fully implemented  
- ✔ Multi-hop reasoning verified  
- ✔ Explainability layers functional  
- ✔ Import/export stable  
- ✔ Autosave/autoload operational  
- ✔ Developer comfort commands active

## 🏁 Summary  
KG ENGINE 6.x is the symbolic core of SIRIUS Local AI (v5.7.0).  
It manages entities, relations, explainability, and multi-hop reasoning with deterministic precision.  
The engine is fully integrated with Runtime 5.x, ReasoningEngine5, AUTONOMY, and the UI PANEL, forming the foundation of SIRIUS’s transparent and enterprise-ready knowledge system.
