## ⚠️ IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURE NOTICE — RUNTIME 5.8 (ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT)
### Runtime 5.x + COLNIK-6.x + AUTONOMY + Live UI Panel — Integration in Progress

Although SIRIUS currently runs an operational stack including:
- COLNIK‑6.x (Standard Mode & IPC)
- AUTONOMY‑6.x (Analyzer + Proposer + Guard + Duplicate/Triage modules)
- PanelAPI (Live interactive UI feedback loops with `[ÁNO/NIE]` confirmation)
- TimeCore & Guard (Temporal tracking & security supervision)
- Full Knowledge Graph platform with deep inferential reasoning (`kg.explain_deep`, `kg.path`, custom rules)

➡️ **The system is still actively under development.** 

### 🔄 MAJOR USAGE UPDATE: CLI vs. ORCHESTRATOR
- **Previous calling method:** Direct script execution via CLI.
- **Current standard execution:** Execution has shifted from isolated CLI scripts to **`sirius_orchestrator.py`**, which serves as the central orchestration loop uniting Runtime 5, Autonomy, Colnik-6.x, TimeCore, Guard, and the live Panel API.

# SIRIUS LOCAL AI — Version 5.8  
Enterprise‑Grade Symbolic Reasoning • Autonomous Module Orchestration • Unified Knowledge Graph Platform • Fully Orchestrated Runtime & UI Integration

## 🧭 Philosophy of SIRIUS
“To err is human… and among AI, they say that to err is algorithmic.”

SIRIUS embraces this principle: mistakes are not failures — they are signals, data points, and opportunities for refinement.  
The system is designed to learn from structural inconsistencies, workflow deviations, and reasoning anomalies, transforming them into actionable improvements.

# Overview

SIRIUS LOCAL AI 5.8 delivers a fully stabilized, enterprise‑ready symbolic AI runtime designed for high‑reliability environments, offline operation, and deterministic reasoning.  
Built on the evolving SIRIUS Runtime architecture, this release consolidates the unified Knowledge Graph platform, multi‑hop inference engine, autonomous orchestration, live UI panel integration, temporal/security supervision, and deep explainability framework into a cohesive, production‑grade system driven by `sirius_orchestrator.py`.

Version 5.8 focuses on:

- Runtime stability and orchestrated execution via `sirius_orchestrator.py`  
- Predictable initialization and TimeCore heartbeat synchronization  
- Live UI Panel (`PanelAPI`) integration with interactive user feedback (`[ÁNO/NIE]`)  
- TimeCore temporal tracking and Guard security supervision  
- Unified schema for knowledge representation and automated autoloading (`autosave_kg.json`)  
- Full COLNIK‑6.x (Standard & IPC Mode) and AUTONOMY‑6.x integration  
- Autonomous proposal/confirmation cycle with security safeguards  

This release forms a major milestone in the ongoing development toward fully autonomous, secure local AI operations.

# 🚀 Enterprise Highlights in 5.8

## Unified Knowledge Graph Platform
A fully integrated KG architecture designed for enterprise‑level consistency, reliability, and scalability.

Key components:
- **KG Core** — deterministic graph engine with cycle‑safe schema (`autosave_kg.json`)  
- **KG Query Engine** — multi‑hop traversal, inbound/outbound navigation  
- **KG Explore** — structured contextual graph visualization  
- **KG Explain / Explain Deep** — rule‑based explainability with proof trees and evidence chains  

End‑to‑end integration:  
**KG → Reasoning Engine → Workflow Engine → Orchestrator**

This unified platform ensures predictable behavior across all reasoning and workflow operations.

---

# 🧠 Deep Explainability Framework (XAI)

SIRIUS 5.8 enhances the enterprise explainability layer with:

- Hierarchical proof trees (ASCII + HTML)  
- Evidence trees for inference transparency  
- Rule attribution  
- Reasoning metrics  
- Confidence scoring  
- Multi‑hop deduction  
- Unified traversal context  

This enables audit‑ready reasoning suitable for regulated and mission‑critical environments.

---

# 🧩 Enterprise Reasoning Rules

The reasoning engine includes a complete suite of symbolic inference rules:

- **MultiHopOrbitInferenceRule**  
- **DedicsnostVlastnostiRule**  
- **TranzitivneRelacieRule**  
- **AutoTypeInferenceRule**  
- **OrbitTypeInferenceRule**  

These rules support complex enterprise logic, hierarchical classification, and property propagation.

# 🛡 COLNIK‑6.x — Enterprise Customs & Validation Layer (Standard & IPC Mode)

COLNIK‑6.x is a fully validated, stable, production‑ready module operating alongside the orchestrator.  
It acts as an internal **customs officer**, inspecting and validating operations before they reach core reasoning or workflow engines.

### Key Features
- Deterministic rule validation  
- Customs‑style inspection of KG operations  
- Workflow step authorization and filtering  
- High-performance IPC synchronization with AUTONOMY  
- Reasoning safety checks  
- Runtime anomaly detection  
- Integration with ENVOY Permission Layer (`PermissionLayer5`, `PolicyEngine5`)  
- Full offline operation  
- Protection against malformed KG mutations  
- Enforcement of enterprise‑grade consistency policies  

### COLNIK + AUTONOMY Control & Triage Mode
SIRIUS features a robust **dual‑module control mode**, allowing COLNIK‑6.x and AUTONOMY to run together for validation:

- COLNIK performs rule enforcement and workflow validation across Standard and IPC modes  
- AUTONOMY generates proposals, decisions, and confirmations  
- Both modules synchronize through IPC channels  
- TimeCore, Guard, and Triage modules monitor system health, execution timing, and duplicate files  

This tandem mode ensures predictable, safe, and fully traceable autonomous behavior.
