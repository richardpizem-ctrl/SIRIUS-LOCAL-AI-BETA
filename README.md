SIRIUS LOCAL AI is a fully modular, local‑only AI runtime designed to safely execute user commands on a single PC.  
It understands natural language, interprets tasks, manages workflows, loads plugins, and interacts with Windows 11 through a secure capability layer.

This project focuses on **safety**, **predictability**, **modularity**, and **full local control**.

All processing is fully offline — no cloud, no telemetry, no external dependencies.

# ℹ️ About SIRIUS LOCAL AI

SIRIUS LOCAL AI is a fully local, modular AI runtime for Windows 11 designed for developers, testers, and power‑users who need safe, deterministic automation on a single PC.  
It provides a complete runtime architecture (Runtime 2.0) with a plugin system, workflow engine, natural‑language routing, Windows capability layer, and advanced safety modules — all running fully offline.

Unlike cloud‑based AI agents, SIRIUS LOCAL AI executes every operation locally, ensuring privacy, predictability, and full user control.  
The system is distributed as clean Python source code and is built as a long‑term, extensible platform for local AI automation.

**Key characteristics:**
- 100% offline, no telemetry  
- modular architecture with replaceable components  
- deterministic behavior and strict safety boundaries  
- plugin ecosystem for extending capabilities  
- workflow automation and NL command routing  
- Windows 11 integration through a secure capability layer  
- upcoming intelligent features (identity, time‑limits, schoolwork priority) in v3.0.0  

SIRIUS LOCAL AI aims to become a new category of software:  
a **local AI runtime** that safely controls a Windows PC through natural language.

# 🛡 SECURITY FAMILY — Offline Family Safety Engine (v3.0.0+)

**SECURITY FAMILY** is a unique, fully offline safety system designed for households, shared computers, and controlled environments.  
It introduces identity‑based protection, time‑limits, restricted modes, and schoolwork priority — all without cloud services or biometrics.

### 🔐 Core Capabilities
- **Behavior‑Based Identity Engine**  
  Recognizes users by behavior patterns.  
  Identity levels: **OWNER / FAMILY / STRANGER**.

- **Time‑Limits for Children**  
  Intelligent time‑based restrictions with automatic mode switching.

- **Restricted Mode for Unknown Users**  
  Unknown users cannot perform sensitive or destructive operations.

- **Schoolwork Priority Mode**  
  Schoolwork is *always allowed*, even when time limits are exceeded.  
  Automatically triggered by AITE (Automatic Input Triage Engine).

- **Safe‑Mode for Sensitive Operations**  
  High‑risk commands require explicit OWNER approval.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
SECURITY FAMILY makes SIRIUS LOCAL AI the **first fully local AI runtime** that combines:

- OS‑level automation  
- modular AI architecture  
- natural‑language control  
- **family‑safe offline protection**

No cloud AI system offers this combination.

# 🧩 Core Philosophy

- **Local‑only AI** — no cloud, no external services  
- **Modular architecture** — every capability is isolated  
- **Predictable behavior** — no hidden actions, no automation without confirmation  
- **Human‑controlled** — SIRIUS never performs destructive actions without explicit approval  
- **Extensible** — Plugin System 2.0 allows new features without modifying the core  
- **Deterministic** — Runtime 2.0 ensures stable, repeatable behavior  
- **Family‑safe** — SECURITY FAMILY (v3.0.0) introduces identity, time‑limits, and schoolwork priority

# 🏗 Architecture Overview (v2.0.0)

SIRIUS LOCAL AI is composed of independent modules that communicate through defined interfaces.  
Each module has a single responsibility and is replaceable.
