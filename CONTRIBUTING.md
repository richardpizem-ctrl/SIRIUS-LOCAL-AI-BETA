# 🤝 Contributing Guidelines – SIRIUS LOCAL AI (v3.0.0)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **SIRIUS LOCAL AI**.  
This document defines the rules, processes, and expectations for all contributors.  
The goal is to maintain a **clean, safe, modular, and predictable** local AI system built on the stable Runtime 3.0 architecture.

All processing is fully local.  
No data leaves your PC.

# 1. 🔐 Core Principles

- **Security has absolute priority**  
- **No action may bypass user confirmations**  
- **Modular architecture must remain clean and separated**  
- **All contributions must respect existing module APIs**  
- **No network operations or external data transmission**  
- **No hidden automation or background actions**  
- **Every change must preserve system transparency and predictability**  
- **No global mutable state**  
- **No circular imports**  
- **Deterministic, reversible behavior whenever possible**  
- **Plugin System 3.0 rules must be followed**  
- **Safety‑critical modules (SECURITY FAMILY, SCHOOLWORK PRIORITY MODE) must never be weakened or bypassed**

# 2. 🚀 How to Start

1. **Fork** the repository  
2. **Create a new branch** for your change  
3. **Implement** the change according to the architecture  
4. **Test** it in your local environment  
5. **Submit a Pull Request** with a clear description  

Recommended branch naming:
- feature/<name>  
- fix/<name>  
- refactor/<name>  
- docs/<name>

# 3. 🧼 Code Style

All contributions must follow the project’s **STYLEGUIDE.md**.

Key rules:

- clean, readable, consistent  
- no magic constants  
- clear naming of functions and modules  
- comments explain **why**, not **what**  
- avoid unnecessary complexity  
- follow the architecture and module map  
- functions ideally 5–25 lines  
- no monolithic modules  
- no deep nesting — prefer early returns  
- imports grouped: standard → third‑party → internal  
- plugin code must follow Plugin API 3.0  
- SECURITY FAMILY code must follow safety‑first design  
- SCHOOLWORK PRIORITY MODE must remain intact and non‑bypassable  

---

# 4. 🧪 Testing Requirements

Every change must include:

- basic functional tests  
- verification of security constraints  
- input validation  
- error‑state testing  
- predictable behavior under invalid inputs  
- no silent failures  
- no destructive operations without confirmation  
- no reliance on network access  

If your change affects:

- **FS‑AGENT 3.0** → test path validation, safety prompts  
- **NL Router 3.0** → test ambiguity handling and routing  
- **Workflow Engine 3.0** → test state transitions  
- **AI Loop 3.0** → test interval rule execution  
- **WIN‑CAP 3.0** → test safe fallback behavior  
- **Plugin System 3.0** → test manifest, NL commands, tasks, workflows, GUI elements  
- **SECURITY FAMILY (v3.0.0)** →  
  - identity classification (OWNER / FAMILY / STRANGER)  
  - time‑limit enforcement  
  - schoolwork bypass logic  
  - safe‑mode restrictions  
  - STRANGER‑mode protections

# 5. 📥 Pull Request Rules

A valid PR must include:

- clear description of the change  
- explanation of why the change is needed  
- reference to related Issues (if applicable)  
- test results or manual test notes  

Restrictions:

- no large PRs — prefer smaller, well‑structured steps  
- PRs must **not** modify the architecture without prior discussion  
- PRs must follow module boundaries  
- PRs must not introduce new dependencies without approval  
- PRs must not break determinism or safety guarantees  
- plugin PRs must include updated manifest if needed  
- PRs must not weaken SECURITY FAMILY protections  
- PRs must not interfere with SCHOOLWORK PRIORITY MODE

# 6. ❌ What We Do Not Accept

- network‑based features  
- automatic actions without confirmation  
- bypassing security rules  
- monolithic modules  
- undocumented API changes  
- hidden background tasks  
- features that break modularity  
- unsafe filesystem or system operations  
- code that relies on OS‑specific hacks  
- contributions that reduce clarity or predictability  
- plugins that violate Plugin API 3.0  
- attempts to disable FAMILY mode, time limits, or schoolwork priority  
- attempts to weaken STRANGER‑mode protections  

---

# 7. 💬 Communication

All discussions take place through:

- **Issues**  
- **Pull Request comments**  

Guidelines:

- be respectful and constructive  
- provide technical reasoning  
- avoid vague or incomplete reports  
- include reproduction steps when reporting issues  

---

# 8. 🧭 Architecture Compliance

All contributions must respect:

- **ARCHITECTURE.md**  
- **MODULE_MAP.md**  
- **STYLEGUIDE.md**  
- **SECURITY.md**  
- **Plugin API 3.0**  
- **SECURITY FAMILY design rules (v3.0.0)**  
- **Schoolwork Priority Mode rules**  

Breaking architectural boundaries requires prior approval.

---

# 9. 📝 Commit Message Style

Use clear, structured commit messages:

- feat: added new workflow validation  
- fix: corrected path resolution in FS‑AGENT  
- refactor: simplified NL routing logic  
- docs: updated INSTALLATION.md  

Avoid vague messages like “update”, “fix stuff”, “changes”.

# 10. 🧒 Family Safety Requirements (v3.0.0)

Contributors must respect the integrity of the **SECURITY FAMILY** module:

- behavior‑based identity must remain deterministic  
- FAMILY mode must remain safe and restricted  
- time‑limits must not be bypassable  
- **schoolwork must always be allowed**  
- stranger‑mode must remain locked down  
- OWNER‑level actions must remain protected  
- no PR may weaken or circumvent these protections  

Any PR affecting SECURITY FAMILY must include **explicit safety tests**.
