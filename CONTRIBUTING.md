# 🤝 Contributing Guidelines – SIRIUS LOCAL AI (v5.6.2 UNIFIED)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **SIRIUS LOCAL AI**.  
This document defines the rules, processes, and expectations for all contributors.  
The goal is to maintain a **clean, safe, modular, deterministic, explainable, and intelligent** local AI system built on the **Unified Reasoning & Deep Explainability Architecture 5.6.2**.

All processing is fully local.  
No data leaves your device.

Version **5.6.2** updates these guidelines to include:

- **Unified Reasoning & Deep Explainability Architecture 5.6.2**  
- **KG_EXPLAIN & KG_EXPLAIN_DEEP (Explainability Engines)**  
- **Reasoning Engine 5.6.2 (multi-hop, inheritance, transitivity)**  
- **Proof Tree & Evidence Tree Foundations**  
- **Confidence Scoring Foundations**  
- **Rule Chaining Foundations**  
- **Workflow Engine 5.6.2 (explainability routing)**  
- **Unified Knowledge Graph 5.6.2 (comfort commands, stabilized autoload)**  
- **AITE 5.6.2 (semantic + explainability triage)**  
- **Identity Engine 3.0**  
- **SECURITY FAMILY 5.x**  
- **Schoolwork Engine 5.6.2**  
- **System Agent 5**  
- **COLNIK‑6.x Validation Layer**  
- hardened deterministic routing  
- cross-platform safety rules
