# 📦 Installation Guide – SIRIUS LOCAL AI (v2.0.0)

SIRIUS LOCAL AI is a fully local, modular AI runtime built on the stable Runtime 2.0 architecture.  
The system is currently distributed as clean Python source code, intended for developers, testers, and advanced users.

A packaged installer will be introduced in a future release.

All processing is fully local; no data leaves your PC.

## ⚠️ System Notes (v2.0.0)

SIRIUS LOCAL AI interacts with Windows 11 system APIs, including:

- filesystem operations  
- window management  
- application control  
- accessibility interfaces  
- plugin‑driven system actions  
- **(v3.0.0) SECURITY FAMILY safety hooks for identity, time‑limits, and schoolwork priority**

Windows Defender or SmartScreen may classify the runtime as an “Unknown App”.  
Antivirus tools may generate false positives during development.

All modules operate offline, with strict safety boundaries and deterministic behavior.

## 🔧 How to Run (Developer Mode)

1. Install **Python 3.10+**
2. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/richardpizem-ctrl/SIRIUS-LOCAL-AI-ALFA
```
3. Open the project in VS Code or any terminal  
4. Run the main entrypoint:
```
python sirius.py
```
5. Optional: run individual modules for testing (runtime, plugins, GUI, workflows)

Developer mode provides full access to:

- Runtime Core 2.0  
- Plugin System 2.0  
- Workflow Engine 2.0  
- AI Loop 2.0  
- GUI 2.0  
- AITE 2.0  
- WIN‑CAP 2.0  
- **SECURITY FAMILY scaffolding (identity engine, time‑limits, schoolwork bypass)**

## 🛠️ Future Installation System (Planned)

### v2.1.0 – Basic Packaging
- simple startup executable  
- minimal Windows integration  
- bundled Python environment  
- plugin auto‑loader  

### v3.0.0 – Intelligent Runtime Builds
- optional UI/animation bundles  
- performance‑optimized packaging  
- tray/voice integration  
- semantic triage extensions  
- **SECURITY FAMILY integration (behavior‑based identity, time‑limits, schoolwork priority mode)**  

### v4.0.0 – Self‑Repair & Health‑Check Layer
The installation system will integrate with the diagnostic layer:

- integrity checks before startup  
- detection of corrupted configs or missing files  
- automatic safe repairs (cache reset, index rebuild, default config restore)  
- pre‑launch validation  
- user‑approved patch suggestions  

This ensures long‑term stability even in packaged builds.
